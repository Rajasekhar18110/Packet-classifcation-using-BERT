### Packet classification using machine learning models BERT and RoBERTa

##### This is part of my Btech project
- We are implementing BERT (Bidirectional Encoders Representations from Transformers) and RoBERTa (Robustly optimised BERT pre training approach) models in this project.
- BERT  is a state of the art machine learning model published by researchers at Google (2018). It has far better performance in various NLP tasks. 
- RoBERTa is improved version of BERT published by researchers at facebook.
